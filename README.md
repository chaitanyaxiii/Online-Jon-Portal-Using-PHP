 Job Portal Project

 Description

This project is a comprehensive Job Portal developed using PHP and MySQL, designed to connect employers and job seekers effectively. Employers can register, post job openings, and manage applications, while job seekers can create profiles, upload resumes, and apply for jobs seamlessly. The platform offers a user-friendly interface and essential functionalities to streamline the recruitment process.

The project includes separate sections for administrators, employers, and job seekers, ensuring tailored features for each user role. Employers can view applications and shortlist candidates, while job seekers can explore opportunities and track their application statuses. The administrator oversees the entire portal, managing users and maintaining database integrity.

The system is easy to deploy and configure, making it suitable for small and mediumsized businesses or as a learning project for web development enthusiasts.
